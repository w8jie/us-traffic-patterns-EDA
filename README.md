# us-traffic-patterns-EDA

**Objective:** In this project, I clean, wrangle, model and visualise US traffic pattners from 2015, with the goal of gathering five different insightful patterns from the data source. I will also discuss my thought process as well as possible furture works at the end of my analysis.

**How to use:** 
  1. Clone depository
  2. Run Jupyter Notebook file (analysis.ipynb)
  3. Run all packages and pip install xgboost
  4. **NOTE:** The two data source files were not uploaded in the git depo as the files were too large (input/dot_traffic_2015.txt.gz and input/dot_traffic_stations_2015.txt.gz)
